## Compilation

The compile process follows the same style as Assignment 0.

## Manual

Objectives were completed as defined by the assignment.

An additional wirerfame was added over each of the cubes for visibility.

Assumptions:

 * Scaling does not require the grid to remain in the relative position in the screen

## Compilation Continued

 Compilation follows the standard process defined by the A0 sample project:

 No changes have been made from the default project compilation tools.

 The following is from the 'README.md' of the sample CS488 course project.  It defines the steps necessary to build the A0 project.

 ## Dependencies
 * OpenGL 3.2+
 * GLFW
     * http://www.glfw.org/
 * Lua
     * http://www.lua.org/
 * Premake4
     * https://github.com/premake/premake-4.x/wiki
     * http://premake.github.io/download.html
 * GLM

 ## Building Projects
 We use **premake4** as our cross-platform build system. First you will need to build all
 the static libraries that the projects depend on. To build the libraries, open up a
 terminal, and **cd** to the top level of the CS488 project directory and then run the
 following:

     $ premake4 gmake
     $ make

 This will build the following static libraries, and place them in the top level **lib**
 folder of your cs488 project directory.
 * libcs488-framework.a
 * libglfw3.a
 * libimgui.a

 Next we can build a specific project.  To do this, **cd** into one of the project folders,
 say **A0** for example, and run the following terminal commands in order to compile the A0 executable using all .cpp files in the A0 directory:

     $ cd A0/
     $ premake4 gmake
     $ make
